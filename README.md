## Rules
### Formatting Rules
* Convert all the accented alphabet in a name with a basic form
* Delete all the hyphens "-" in a name (e.g. Zo-Zo -> ZoZo)

### Model Naming Rules
* \<LIBRARY\>\_\<MODEL NAME\>\_\<MODEL TYPE\>\_\<STORY TITLE\>.pickle
* Model types are as follows:
  * spacy_doc
    * processed text by a Spacy NLP model
    * Since the original text processing takes more time than buliding the model itself, we save doc objects.
    * _spacy_doc_trf\_\<STORY TITLE\>.pickle_ (Transformers-Model-processed texts)
